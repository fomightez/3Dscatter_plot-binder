- You may want to check out my notes at [my 3Dscatter_plot_mod_playground-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/3Dscatter_plot_mod_playground-binder) if you happen to be using cutting edge Jupyter & looking to apply what you see here, and/or need to use `ipympl/widgets`. The code in this current version of this repo was written to work originally with what is now NbClassic, but when MyBinder changed recently to update to use more current Jupyter (Jupyter Notebook 7.2.2 in test done just now, I was pleasantly suprised everything seemed to work 'as-is' in the new Jupyter, unlike [my animated_matplotlib_classic-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/animated_matplotlib_classic-binder) that I had to roll back to NbClassic to keep working. (I think it is because here I am using `%matplotlib inline` not using `widgets/ipympl`.) and I'm still working out what one matches best and if any edits need to be made to keep things working. The README for [my 3Dscatter_plot_mod_playground-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/3Dscatter_plot_mod_playground-binder) discusses things more and specifies how to build the environment at this time, whereas here is more subject to the default.
