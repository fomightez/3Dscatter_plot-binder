    "\n",
    "In [this notebook](3D_scatter_adjustableVIAwidgets.ipynb) you saw widgets can be used to control settings for the plot. (This notebook builds on that, and so you'll probably want to review [that one](3D_scatter_adjustableVIAwidgets.ipynb) first, if you haven't already.)  \n",
    "This can be further combined with additional widgets and Voila to make a dashboard-like web app that allows file upload and plotting where you can then control the plot look in the app dashbaord.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is meant to demonstrate that. You'll need to edit things to match your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note you can use Excel files directly. The code to convert that to Pandas is left in there as commented out code. You can remove the comment symbol and alter the code to handle you files..\n",
    "\n",
    "This opens as a notebook to introduce what is going on in the traditional notebook format. You can run the code as a notebook or switch to the Voila app style by clicking the `Voila` button on the toolbar just above the notebook.\n",

You can go [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality), which leads to [here](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/), and get the white or red data only if you like and use the upload button to upload the data from your local computer. (The code here is set to deal with tab-delimited data and the wine data come as commas-separated values [CSV] and so you need to either edit the code or the data. I've included the code for CSV in comments.)  Alternatively, see the note about using Excel files at the top of this notebook.\n",
